            <p>You are forever altered in some drastic, physical way, perhaps even made monstrous. A blasphemous fusion of science, alchemy, and magic changed you, possibly to mend some unrecoverable malady, or to test the limits of your biology. The process was a success, at least to a point, but the change left its mark on you. The indelible warping of your form can be a source of fear for those who do not understand what they see.</p>

            <h5>BUILDING AN EXPERIMENT</h5>
            <p>An experiment can come from any class or walk of life. Were you kidnapped and altered against your will, or did you volunteer for a heinous procedure? Was the experimenting done purely for discovery, to overcome a worse fate, or for someone to play at being a god? Whatever the reason, the process is never pleasant, and it always leaves scarsâ€”both those you can see and those that have marked your very soul.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Suggested Story Threads.</i></b> The Experiment Story Threads table suggests events and people who can be the start of story threads for your character that weave through the campaign.</p>
            <p><b>Experiemnt Story Threads</b></p>

                </thead>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>A particular song stirs feelings of sadness and overwhelming anger in you, reminding you of the process that changed you.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>A portion of your altered body is very clearly grafted from a different person, and they might want it back.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td>Another person was changed alongside you. They fled before you left, urging you to do the same.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>You have recurring nightmares of the procedure you endured, sometimes seeing glimpses of faces in the dream that you don't recognize.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>Your physical difference invites curiosity and attention, which for some reason is more disturbing than disdain or fear.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td>A peculiar symbol is branded on or near your alteration.</td></tr>
