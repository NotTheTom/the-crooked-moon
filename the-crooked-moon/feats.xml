You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have. Your spellcasting ability for casting the spell in this way is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose the ability when you select this feat).</p>

When another creature is carrying the charm, or while this charm is within an area that the creature considers home, it has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls using the chosen ability. When the creature fails one of these rolls, it can make a Charisma saving throw, destroying the charm on a success (DC = 8 plus your proficiency bonus and the ability modifier you chose for Old Blessing). You can only have one Twisted Hex charm at a time. If you make a new one, the previous one loses its magic.</p>
