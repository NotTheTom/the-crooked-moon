            <p>You were once whole, but part of you has been separated from your being and now also wanders the world. This aspect of you took your reflection and shadow with it, and it travels about as a mirage that looks identical to you. You know this other self is out there—you can feel it—but what it wants and why is lost on you. Sometimes you encounter a stranger that knows you—for good or ill—though you’ve never met them before, and you can’t help but wonder if they met the other you.</p>

            <p>Any character can be a reflected wanderer. How was it that your being came to be divided? How much do you understand about your situation? Are you truly who you think you are, or are you, in reality, the very castoff reflection of your other self ?</p>
