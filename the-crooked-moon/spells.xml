        <description>
            <p>You send your enemies to their graves even if they aren’t dead yet. A creature that you can see within range that is standing on the ground must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the ground opens and swallows the target, burying it up to 10 feet deep. While buried, the target has total cover, has the restrained and blinded conditions, and can’t breathe. On a successful save, the target is knocked prone, and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. A buried creature can dig out of the grave by using its action to make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, it digs 5 feet closer to the surface. If it succeeds by 5 or more, it reaches the surface. When the creature reaches the surface, it exits the ground prone.</p>
            <p class="indent">The target automatically succeeds on its saving throw if it’s standing on any thickness of stone or metal, or at least 2 inches of wood.</p>

            <p>You unleash a primal howl that calls lesser creatures to your command. Each Beast in a 100-foot sphere centered on you when you cast the spell must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target is charmed by you, it can understand your commands, and it follows them on its next turn to the best of its ability. On your subsequent turns, you can take an action to issue a new command. On a successful save, a target is charmed by you until the start of your next turn, but you have no additional ability to command it. The howl is audible within 300 feet.</p>

            <p class="indent">While the flames linger, the creature takes the damage again at the start of each of its turns. The target, or another creature within reach of the target, can take an action to allow the target to repeat the saving throw, ending the spell on a success.</p>

Three tendrils then leap from that target to as many as three other targets of your choice, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target.

            <p>You focus on a creature that you are familiar with that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be cursed for the duration. Once a target fails its saving throw against this spell, you can’t target it with a ritual casting of the spell for 24 hours.</p>
            <p class="indent">While cursed, the target hears haunting, discordant music and has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The first time the target fails one of those rolls during a turn, it repeats the save against this spell with neither advantage nor disadvantage, ending the spell early on a success.</p>

            <p>You summon and unleash a murder of deadly crows. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot cone originating from you makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 5d6 force damage and is blinded. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only. A blinded creature repeats the save at theend of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect also ends if the creature regains any hit points. The crows disperse and vanish after they strike.</p>
