            <p><i>Once equipped, this item grants you the Bestial Awakening Dark Bargain.</i></p>
            <p>The feral world calls to your soul, howling for you to join it. You can give in to the call and transform into a beast, but the touch of silver bites you more deeply than the sharpest fang.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Beast Skin.</i></b> You can cast the <i>Polymorph</i> spell using this benefit without requiring a material component. Once you cast the spell with this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast it using slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spell when you cast it without a spell slot (choose the ability when you select this Dark Bargain).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Searing Silver.</i></b> Damage from silvered weapons ignores any resistance or immunity to damage you have. If you take damage from a silvered weapon or touch silver with your bare skin (or its equivalent), you can’t regain hit points until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

            <p><i>Once equipped, this item grants you the Call of the Lonely Dark Bargain.</i></p>
            <p>In the depths of your solitude, and when your hope withered on the branch, you were granted a companion you can call on. You never have to be alone again. This companion is friendly toward you but is deeply unsettling to your allies.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Never Alone.</i></b> When no other creature can see you, you can use a bonus action to call your companion, which appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. It takes the form of a person or a vague silhouette, and it uses the Doppelganger stat block. It is friendly toward you and acts as your ally, and it takes its turn on your initiative in combat. It disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, when you die, or when you use an action to politely dismiss it. When it disappears, it drops anything it was wearing or carrying.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once you use this bonus action, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Precocious Friend.</i></b> The companion sometimes appears with trinkets, Cursed Curios, or other items. It might tell you where it got them, or it might not (GM’s choice). If it took the object from someone who misses it or wants it back, that could create difficulties for you.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Unsettling Presence.</i></b> While your companion is summoned, both it and you exude a frightful air that unnerves your allies. While the companion is summoned, a creature that isn’t hostile toward you that starts its turn able to see you or the companion must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of its next turn.</p>

            <p><i>Once equipped, this item grants you the Collector of Stories Dark Bargain.</i></p>
            <p>You have an insatiable desire to gather the tales of the world. Sometimes, you inadvertently take the story of meeting another person and keep it to yourself, forever.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Gathered Tales.</i></b> You can cast the Legend Lore spell with this bargain without requiring spell components. Once you cast it using this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast it using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

            <p class="indent"><b><i>Hoarded Stories.</i></b> When you use this bargain to cast Legend Lore, a friendly NPC (the GM chooses) forgets ever meeting you. You can meet them again and attempt to rebuild a relationship, but you forever cause an unsettling discomfort in them. That NPC’s attitude toward you can’t ever improve beyond indifferent, and you have disadvantage on all Charisma checks against them.</p>

            <p><i>Once equipped, this item grants you the Crooked Fortune Dark Bargain.</i></p>
            <p>The crooked fate that governs Druskenvald has taken a liking to you. You can avoid calamity, but you must pay back your good fortune eventually.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Cheat Fate.</i></b> When you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. When you do so, if you would take half damage on a successful save, you take no damage instead. Once you use Cheat Fate, you can’t use it again until you pay the price (see below).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Delayed Price.</i></b> After you use Cheat Fate, your next three saving throws have disadvantage and can’t have advantage, and you gain 1 level of exhaustion when you succeed on one of the saves. Once you succeed or fail on the third saving throw, you regain the use of Cheat Fate. The powers that govern the warp and weft of fate don’t take kindly to cheating outside their terms—at the GM’s discretion, saving throws made intentionally or without true consequences simply to pay this price painlessly don’t count.</p>

            <p>You can snatch others from the jaws of death, but your own grip lingers too tightly. The feeling of saving others from suffering fills you with resolve, even as it drains the vigor from those you rescue.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Critical Savior.</i></b> When a creature within 120 feet of you is subjected to a critical hit or is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to magically switch places with the target. Each of you teleports to the other’s space. Roll a number of d6s equal to half your level. You take force damage equal to the total rolled, you gain inspiration, and your exhaustion level is reduced by 1. The target regains hit points equal to the total rolled and gains 1 level of exhaustion. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Draining Presence.</i></b> When you finish a short or long rest, each creature within 100 feet of you loses one Hit Die (before spending Hit Dice in the case of finishing a short rest).</p>

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spell when you cast it without a spell slot (choose the ability when you select this Dark Bargain).</p>
            <p class="indent">When you cast the spell this way, you die, and nothing can prevent it. Your soul is bound to torment the creature you returned to life, and you can’t be raised from the dead by any means. When the creature takes a long rest, it must roll a d20 halfway through the rest’s duration. On a 1, your soul takes the form of a Wraith within 100 feet of the creature and tries to kill it. The wraith vanishes after 8 hours, or when it dies. Once the wraith appears, it can’t appear again for 30 days.</p>

The fury ends if you are incapacitated, if you die, or if you end your turn and there are no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. You also regain the use of this feature when you kill a Humanoid.</p>

On a successful save, you can choose to end your fury or continue it. On a failed save, you no longer make the saving throw at the start of your turns, and you regard the creature nearest to you that you can see or hear as your enemy (if there are multiple, choose one at random). On each of your turns, you must move as close to the creature as possible and take the Attack action, targeting that creature with melee attacks. If you’re unable to get close enough to the creature to attack it, your turn ends after you’ve used up all your available movement. If the creature dies or can no longer be seen or heard by you, the next nearest creature that you can see or hear becomes your new target.</p>
