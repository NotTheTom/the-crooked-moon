            <p>Youâ€™ve made your bones on games of chance, and one day your games crossed the line into something far more serious. You might have played for your soul against a Fiend, matched wits with ancient forest Fey in a riddle contest, or rolled dice with the fabled Mister Crossroads.</p>

            <h5>BUILDING A CROSSROADS GAMBLER</h5>
            <p>Characters who live by their wits, such as rogues and bards, find the call of a crossroads gambler appealing, though anyone could find themselves in the position of playing for stakes higher than they could ever imagine... or pay. A spellcaster who conjured the wrong entity may find themself a gambler. The desperate who sought out a mysterious figure to throw dice and match wits for power or salvation can find their fates bound to the crossroads.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Suggested Story Threads</i></b> The Crossroads Gambler Story Threads table suggests events and people who can be the start of story threads for your character that weave through the campaign.</p>
