            <p>You know the ancient rites kept alive by secretive druids and hedge practitioners in the shadowed groves of the primordial forests. Remedies and hexes woven into wicker charms can stave off misfortune and ward away evil. They could just as likely invite gloom and the ire of the old spirits.</p>

            <h5>BUILDING A WICKER Weaver</h5>
            <p>Compassionate characters driven by a deep connection to the land and a passion to protect it become wicker weavers. Druids of other circles might trade knowledge with the Circle of Wicker. Healers and guardians alike may seek out the Old Ways for remedies and protective charms to ward off evil. Not all who come to the wicker craft do so with noble intentâ€”some, broken by spite and twisted by their pain, wield the power of the wicker into malicious revenge, lashing out with curses bound in twig and bone and inflicting the wrath of the forest upon those who wronged them.</p>
