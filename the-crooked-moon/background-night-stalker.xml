            <p>Once you were prey, stalked by a monster through the dark of night. Now, you are the hunter, and the things which you once feared will learn the true meaning of dread. You have become far deadlier, hungrier, and crueler than the monster that once hunted you. You are, yourself, the monster nowâ€”a fearsome creature once thought to slake its hunger on you or those close to you. You survived, and your would-be killer will have its own destruction in turn.</p>

            <h5>BUILDING A NIGHT STALKER</h5>
            <p>Consider how you joined the hunt against the creatures of the night. Did you lose someone close to you or survive an attack? Perhaps you were raised in a family line of dedicated hunters. Rangers, rogues, and barbarians make fearsome night stalkers, as does any character with a passion to oppose these deadly creatures.</p>
