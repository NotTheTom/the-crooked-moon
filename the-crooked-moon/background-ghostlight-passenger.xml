            <p>Once, even before your most recent travel to Druskenvald, you rode the deathly train known as the <i>Ghostlight Express</i>. Your memories of that journey might be hazy and dreamlike, or they could be sharp and jarring in their clarity. You learned some of the workings of the ghostly engine and formed a connection with the conductor and fellow travelers that has stayed with you. At times, you are even more comfortable with the dead than the living.</p>

            <h5>BUILDING A GHOSTLIGHT PASSENGER</h5>
            <p>Every person in Druskenvald travels the <i>Ghostlight Express</i> at least once, but very few form the deep and lasting connection that you have. Your first trip on the train might have been a near death experience from which you were saved, or perhaps you did die in earnest but were resurrected later.</p>
            <p class="indent">Characters attuned to spirits or the lands of the dead, such as clerics, paladins, or those who had brushes with death, are the most common to exhibit this deep connection.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Suggested Story Threads.</i></b> The Ghostlight Passenger Story Threads table suggests events and people who can be the start of story threads for your character that weave through the campaign.</p>
