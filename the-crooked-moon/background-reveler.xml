            <p>For a time, you traveled with the Lord of Fools’ strange and unsettling revelry. Whether you are still welcome in that company, or you’ve struck off on your own, your time with the troupe revealed some of its nature to you—that the Lord of Fools serves some great entity who prizes humor and merriment, often at the expense of the mighty. But he is no mere jester. Beneath the mask of mockery and merriment is a mad creature who demands sacrifice.</p>

            <h5>BUILDING A REVELER</h5>
            <p>The simultaneous beauty and uncomfortable truth of the revelers is that they can be anyone. Hidden by their masks and costumes, one’s friends, family, servants, or lords could be capering about the ribbon-twined pole and leading impressionable folk away when the revel withdraws. How might a reveler behave differently in each guise?</p>
