        <description>
            <p>You have been inducted into a secret society that venerates or pursues power from some otherworldly source. The cultists might serve as minions of an entity they worship, or they may seek to understand and claim its might for their own. Depending on the malevolence of the cult’s patron or the malefic purposes they may serve, cultists could be a force of wickedness or a group of closely bonded and dedicated people who pursue a common, if esoteric, goal.</p>

            <h5>CULT VENERATION</h5>
            <p>Cults propitiate beings of otherworldly power in hopes of sharing in that potency. Choose what type of cult you joined, such as the following.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Aberration.</i></b> Alien creatures with inscrutable mindsets and motivations. Many originate from outside the known multiverse.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Celestial.</i></b> Beings of the Upper Planes, and paragons of order or benevolence. Many can be overbearing and uncompromising.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Fiend (Demon).</i></b> Creatures of utter evil and destruction that want to see all worlds and planes burn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Fiend (Devil).</i></b> Beings of cunning wickedness who prize structure and obedience. They seek to subjugate others and condemn souls.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Fey.</i></b> Capricious beings often associated with nature and emotional extremes. They can be beautiful, terrible, intoxicating, and horrific.</p>
            <h5>BUILDING A CULTIST</h5>
            <p>Cultists are often lost souls—individuals severed from the fabric of society whose cult became a manipulative, surrogate family. Consider if your character agrees with the aims of the cult, if they fled the group, or if they remain for infiltration purposes.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Suggested Story Threads.</i></b> The Cultist Story Threads table suggests events and people who can be the start of story threads for your character that weave through the campaign.</p>
